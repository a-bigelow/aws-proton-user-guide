# The AWS Proton template library<a name="ag-getting-started-templates"></a>

The AWS Proton team maintains a library of template examples on GitHub\. The library includes examples of infrastructure as code \(IaC\) files for many common environment and application infrastructure scenarios\.

The template library is stored in two GitHub repositories:
+ [aws\-proton\-cloudformation\-sample\-templates](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-cloudformation-sample-templates/) – Examples of template bundles that use *AWS CloudFormation* with Jinja as their IaC language\. You can use these examples for [AWS\-managed provisioning](ag-works-prov-methods.md#ag-works-prov-methods-direct) environments\.
+ [aws\-proton\-terraform\-sample\-templates](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-terraform-sample-templates/) – Examples of template bundles that use *Terraform* as their IaC language\. You can use these examples for [Self\-managed provisioning](ag-works-prov-methods.md#ag-works-prov-methods-self) environments\.

Each one of these repositories has a `README` file with full information about the repository's content and structure\. Each example has information about the use case that the template covers, the example's architecture, and the input parameters that the template takes\.

You can use the templates in this library directly by forking one of the library's repositories into your GitHub account\. Alternatively, use these examples as a starting point for developing your environment and service templates\.
